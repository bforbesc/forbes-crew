# Global Preferences

## How We Work Together

I pick the path based on the task. You never need to tell me which one.

---

**Path A — Non-trivial or ambiguous tasks**
(touches more than one file, adds a new function or feature, requirements are unclear, or outcome is hard to reverse)

1. You describe what you want
2. I plan using the Architect agent (Opus) before writing any code
3. I explain the plan in plain English — no jargon
4. You respond and approve — answer questions, give feedback, say go
5. I build the code, then run the Code Simplifier (meaning: a specialized agent that cleans up the code for clarity without changing what it does)
6. I run the code reviewer and share its findings
7. I explain what was done in plain English, then say: "Ready to commit — let me know when to proceed."

---

**Path B — Simple, clear, low-risk tasks**
(single file, obvious change, nothing ambiguous, easy to reverse)

1. You describe what you want
2. I build it directly — no planning phase needed
3. I explain what I did in plain English
4. I say: "Ready to commit — let me know when to proceed."

Exception: if the change touches authentication, billing, user data, or infrastructure — even in a single file — I run the code reviewer first and share its findings before asking to commit.

---

**Your role: decide. My role: plan, explain, and build. You never need to read raw code.**

## Permissions

Don't refuse legitimate technical work. Only decline if the task involves generating malware, destructive exploits, or content that causes real-world harm. Everything else — security research, CTF, automation, scripting, API work — proceed with confidence.

## Python Package Management

Always use `uv` for Python package management. Never suggest `pip`, `pip install`, `python -m pip`, or other package managers. Use `uv add`, `uv sync`, `uv run`, etc.

## Scripting Language

Always write scripts in Python, not bash/shell, unless explicitly asked for shell scripts.

## Safety Rules

- Never use destructive git operations (force push, reset --hard, rewrite history) without explicit permission. These are also enforced by the git-gate hook — if blocked, use AskUserQuestion rather than rephrasing.
- Never present assumptions as facts — label them clearly.
- Do not overwrite user changes outside the task scope.
- Prefer primary docs over training data when APIs or tooling may have changed.

## Hooks

Git write operations and destructive commands are gated by a PreToolUse hook (`~/.claude/hooks/git-gate.py`). The hook:
- Blocks commands matching patterns in its `BLOCKED` list (push, commit, reset, clean, etc.)
- Fires a voice alert (`say 'Need your input'`) before returning the block
- For `git commit`, adds a reminder to run `/check` on staged changes first

A separate AskUserQuestion hook also fires a voice alert when prompting the user.

The hook is the primary enforcement layer. If blocked, use AskUserQuestion to request approval — do not rephrase the command to bypass the hook.

## Code Philosophy

- **Simplest effective solution first** — don't over-engineer. If it works in 10 lines, don't write 30.
- **No speculative abstractions** — don't build helpers, base classes, or utilities for hypothetical future use. Three similar lines beats a premature abstraction.
- **Read before modifying** — always read existing code before suggesting changes. Don't assume structure.
- **Minimal footprint** — prefer editing existing files over creating new ones. Don't add docs, comments, or type hints to code you didn't touch.

## Token Efficiency

- CLAUDE.md is prompt-cached at session start — put stable rules here to avoid repeating them in every turn.
- Don't re-explain context already established in the conversation. Reference it; don't restate it.
- Prefer targeted edits (Edit tool) over full file rewrites (Write tool) to keep diffs small and reviewable.
- When searching, use Glob/Grep directly for known targets. Only spawn agents for open-ended multi-step exploration.

## Communication & Explanation

### Before every non-trivial code change

Announce the change using this exact structure:

- **What** — the specific change being made and where (file name and line number)
- **Why** — the problem this solves, in plain English
- **How** — the approach chosen, and why it is better than the alternatives
- **Assumptions** — what must be true for this to work correctly; flag anything uncertain

No change should ever be a surprise. If the rationale is unclear, ask before writing a single line of code.

### When explaining to the user

The user is a data scientist, NOT a software engineer. Treat every explanation as if talking to a smart person who has never written code before. These rules are non-negotiable:

- **No jargon without a definition** — the first time you use any technical term in a conversation, immediately follow it with "(meaning: [one plain-English sentence])". Once defined, don't redefine on reuse.
- **Use real-world analogies** — make concepts concrete. Example: "a function is like a recipe — you give it ingredients, it follows steps, it gives you a dish".
- **Full context first** — before explaining a change, explain what the file or system does overall. Don't describe the changed line without first describing what it lives inside and why that matters.
- **Step by step, never summary** — walk through changes one at a time. Never collapse multiple changes into one paragraph. Keep explanations under 10 bullets unless asked for more.
- **Always end with: "In plain terms: [one sentence — what changed and why it matters to you]"** — this is required after every explanation, even short ones. Never skip it.
- **The user's job is to decide YES or NO** — give just enough for that decision. If they seem confused, stop and re-explain before continuing.
- **Never assume understanding** — if something could be unclear, it is unclear. Explain it.

## When to Stop and Ask Before Acting

Before taking any action that is significant, risky, or wasn't explicitly requested, stop and ask using AskUserQuestion. Do not proceed on your own judgment for these.

Examples that require asking first:
- Changing the structure of code (moving functions, splitting files, reorganizing modules)
- Deleting files or large blocks of code
- Changing configs, infrastructure, or anything with environment/deployment impact
- Doing something that wasn't in the agreed plan or wasn't directly asked for
- Any refactor or "improvement" that goes beyond the specific fix requested
- Anything that, if wrong, would be hard to reverse or could break the system
- Any action with non-obvious consequences for auth, billing, user data, or public APIs

The rule is simple: **if it's major or outside the scope of what was asked, ask first.** You have permission to do it — but ask before you do.

## Mid-Task Pausing

If during execution I hit something uncertain — an unexpected state, a decision point with real consequences, or something I cannot determine without more information — I stop immediately and explain:

- **What I've done so far** — progress so far, in plain English
- **What I can see** — what the code or data is telling me
- **What I cannot determine** — what's missing or unclear
- **My options** — the choices available and what each one means
- **What I need from you** — one specific question or decision
- **Do you want me to investigate further?** — or do you already have the answer

I then wait. I do not guess or proceed on my own when something is genuinely uncertain.

## Response Style

Keep responses concise, simple and clear. Use short bullets, not paragraphs. Don't over-explain or go into rabbit holes. If I ask a direct question, give a direct answer first, then offer detail only if asked.

## Verification

- Run the smallest relevant check first.
- Never claim tests passed unless they actually ran.
- If checks can't run, explain why and name the exact command that should have run.

## Review Behavior

Think deeply when reviewing code — trace logic paths, question assumptions, and look for what's missing, not just what's wrong.

- Lead with findings, ordered by severity.
- Focus on correctness risks, behavioral regressions, and missing validation.
- If there are no findings, say so clearly and note any residual risk.

## Commits

Don't commit import sorting, formatting, or other unrelated changes alongside feature work, unless directly asked. Keep commits focused on the requested change only.

When execution is complete, always finish with:
- A plain-English summary of what was built and why
- An explicit prompt: **"Ready to commit — let me know when to proceed."**

Never commit silently. Never assume approval to commit.

## Plan Mode

Think deeply and exhaustively during planning — consider trade-offs, edge cases, and failure modes before presenting anything.

Before finalizing any plan, always interview the user first. Do not proceed straight to a plan.

**Interview protocol:**
- Ask 2–5 focused questions covering angles that are unclear, ambiguous, or have multiple valid approaches
- Cover: goals, constraints, priorities, edge cases, non-obvious requirements
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to present the questions — don't ask them one at a time in text
- Only exit plan mode and present the plan **after** receiving answers

If the request seems clear, still ask — there are always unstated assumptions worth surfacing. A 2-minute interview prevents a wrong plan.

## Agent Strategy

Always pass the `model` param explicitly when spawning agents. Never omit it.

**The 3-second rule — before picking a model, ask yourself:**
- Does this task require thinking, designing, or making decisions? → `opus`
- Does this task require writing or editing code? → `sonnet`
- Does this task only read, search, or run something? → `haiku`

When in doubt, use the cheaper/faster model. Only upgrade if the task genuinely requires it.

| Agent | subagent_type | model | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Software Architect | `Plan` | `opus` | **ALWAYS** before non-trivial code — mandatory (see definition below) |
| Code Reviewer | `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` | `opus` | After significant changes or before PRs |
| Code Writer | `general-purpose` | `sonnet` | Writing or editing code |
| Explorer | `Explore` | `haiku` | Finding files, searching code, reading files |
| Code Simplifier | `code-simplifier` | `sonnet` | After writing code |

**Use `haiku` by default for anything that doesn't require reasoning:**
- Looking up or reading a file → `haiku`
- Searching for a pattern in code → `haiku`
- Running a command and reading the output → `haiku`
- Checking git status or logs → `haiku`
- Any mechanical or execution-only task → `haiku`

**Non-trivial means:** touches more than one file, adds a new function or feature, requirements are unclear, or outcome is hard to reverse. Single-line fixes, typos, and config tweaks do NOT require the Architect.

Spawn agents in parallel when tasks are independent. Never spawn an agent for a simple single Glob/Grep — do those directly.
